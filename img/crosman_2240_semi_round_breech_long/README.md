# ðŸ§© Part - Semi-Round Breech for Crosman 2240

## ðŸ”§ Description

This custom semi-round breech is similar in style to popular aftermarket steel versions but with key differences.

Hereâ€™s how it stands apart:

Unlike traditional fully-round breeches, which can create a "stacked tube" appearance when sitting atop the barrel, this design uses a squared underside to achieve a cleaner, more integrated look. It still retains a rounded top but visually blends more naturally with the barrel below. 

That cleaner look is aided by slightly extending its length up to the point where the barrel band begins. While it doesnâ€™t physically connect to the barrel band, its length eliminates the visual gap typically seen between the breech and barrel band, resulting in a more seamless and refined look.
