# ðŸ§© Part - Full-Length Breech for Crosman 2240

## ðŸ”§ Description

This custom semi-round full-length breech is similar in style to popular aftermarket steel versions but with key differences. 

Hereâ€™s how it stands apart:

Unlike traditional fully-round breeches, which can create a "stacked tube" appearance when sitting atop the barrel, this design uses a squared underside to achieve a cleaner, more integrated look. It still retains a rounded top but visually blends more naturally with the barrel below.

That clean, integrated look is enhanced by extending the breech nearly the entire length of the Crosman 2240â€™s main tube, pushing the barrel band forward to just before the COâ‚‚ filler cap. This eliminates all visible gaps and provides a continuous, uninterrupted line from the back of the breech to the front end of the main tube, resulting in a seamless and refined look.
