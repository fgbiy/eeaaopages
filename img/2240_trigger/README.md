# ðŸ§© Part - Trigger for Crosman 2240

## ðŸ”§ Description

This custom trigger is designed with a slimmer, more refined profile to enhance the visual appeal of the Crosman 2240.

While primarily an aesthetic upgrade, the trigger features a wider surface at the point where it engages the sear, which may also improve firing performance and contribute to greater consistency during use. When made from brass, its natural lubricity and lower friction properties can result in a smoother, more consistent trigger pull. Subtle rounding along the edges adds to the clean, polished appearance, completing the refined look.
