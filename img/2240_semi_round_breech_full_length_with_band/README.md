# ðŸ§© Part - Full-Length Integrated Breech + Barrel Band for Crosman 2240

## ðŸ”§ Description

This custom semi-round full-length breech with an integrated barrel band is similar in style to popular aftermarket steel versions but with key differences.

Hereâ€™s how it stands apart:

Unlike traditional fully-round breeches, which can create a "stacked tube" appearance when sitting atop the barrel, this design uses a squared underside to achieve a cleaner, more integrated look. It still retains a rounded top but visually blends more naturally with the barrel below.

That clean, integrated look is enhanced by extending the breech nearly the entire length of the Crosman 2240â€™s main tube and fully incorporating the barrel band as a single, unified component. The barrel band section of this part ends just before the COâ‚‚ filler cap, effectively relocating the barrel band farther forward than on standard setups. This seamless design eliminates any visible gaps or transition lines along the main tube, creating a continuous, uninterrupted, and streamlined profile that enhances both strength and the sleek, cohesive appearance of the entire unit.
