# ðŸ§© Part - Integrated Semi-Rounded Breech + Barrel Band for Crosman 2240

## ðŸ”§ Description

This custom semi-rounded breech with an integrated barrel band is similar in style to popular aftermarket steel versions but with key differences.

Hereâ€™s how it stands apart:

Unlike traditional fully-rounded breeches, which can create a "stacked tube" appearance when sitting atop the barrel, this design uses a squared underside to achieve a cleaner, more integrated look. It still retains a rounded top but visually blends more naturally with the barrel below.

That clean, integrated look is enhanced by incorporating the barrel band directly into the breech as a single, unified component while preserving the stock barrel band position along the Crosman 2240â€™s main tube. This seamless design eliminates any visible gaps or transition lines between the breech and barrel band, creating a continuous, uninterrupted profile that enhances both strength and the sleek, cohesive appearance of the entire unit.
