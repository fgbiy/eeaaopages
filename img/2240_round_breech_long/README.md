# ðŸ§© Part - Round Breech for Crosman 2240

## ðŸ”§ Description

This custom round breech is similar in style to popular aftermarket steel versions but with a key difference: 

It's slightly longer, extending up to the point where the barrel band begins. While it doesnâ€™t physically connect to the barrel band, its length eliminates the visual gap typically seen between the breech and barrel band, resulting in a more seamless and refined look.
